**Creating macros**
So, you want to create macros? Don't you worry, it's simple!
Use the `$m create <NAME> <CONTENT>`. If you would like to use a macro name with spaces in it, enclose it with "" <- theese guys. Here's an example `$m create "<NAME WITH SPACES>" <CONTENT>` 

**Editing macros**
It's basically same as creating a new one, just use `$m edit` instead of `$m create`
Only author of the original macro OR admin can edit it.

**Deleting macros**
Got bored of one of your macros? Delete it!
Simply use `$m delete <NAME>` or `$m delete "<NAME WITH SPACES>"` 
Only admin or the macro author can do that.

**Searching macros**
You can use regular expressions to find your macros! If you don't know what are theese, `$m find <NAME>` will probably work too.
